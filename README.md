# Amazon-clone.github.io
To build an Amazon clone with the MERN stack, use React for the frontend, handling pages like Home, Product Detail, and Cart with state managed by Context API or Redux. On the backend, set up Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data management. Integrate using Axios or Fetch API, and deploy on platforms like Heroku.
